When requesting an HTTPS URL with twisted.web.client.Agent, the hostname of the
presented certificate will be checked against the requested hostname;
mismatches will now result in an error rather than a man-in-the-middle
opportunity for attackers.  This may break existing code that incorrectly
depended on insecure behavior, but such code was erroneous and should be
updated.
